# Hypr Dots

These are my hyprland dots that I'm currently using on my Arch install, These dots have started from the [Hyprland-v3 dots from JaKooLit](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-v3)

This project isn't to install hyprland and any of the other packages, this is JUST the config files.

## notices

For the manual install make sure to move the wallpapers folder to ~/Pictures/wallpapers.

## How to install

To install and use the configs you can do it in 2 ways, automatic or manual.


### Automatic install

To install it automatically first git clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Luciousdev/hypr-dots.git
```

Then after run the included `installHyprDots.sh` file with the following command:

```
sh installHyprDots.sh
```

Or you can run it like this all merged into one command like this:

```
git clone https://github.com/Luciousdev/hypr-dots.git && cd hypr-dots && sh installHyprDots.sh
```


### Manual install

For the manual install first clone the github repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/Luciousdev/hypr-dots.git
```

After that move all the folders and the `.zshrc` file, besides the wallpapers folder to `~/.config/`
For the wallpaper folder move that inside this directory: `~/Pictures/`
